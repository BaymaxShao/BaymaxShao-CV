title: Multi-functional Robot for Water Quality Detection and Regulation on Small Scale Aquaculture Water
summary: In response to the shortcomings and deficiencies of existing technology, mainly targeting the low efficiency of traditional water quality detection and artificial aquaculture in aquaculture waters, we have designed and manufactured a small water environment water quality monitoring and control water surface robot that can perform image recognition and autonomous path planning.

We have designed and manufactured a multifunctional surface intelligent robot, including a dual hull, fishing mechanism, image recognition and path planning system, water quality detection system, material spraying system, and drive control system; Among them, the dual hull is driven by a drive control system installed at the rear of the dual hull. The dual hull is composed of two parallel and symmetrical single hulls connected. An image recognition and path planning system is installed above the front of the dual hull, a fishing mechanism is installed at the front of the dual hull, a water quality detection system is installed in the middle of the dual hull, and a material spraying system is installed at the rear of the dual hull; The connecting bridge is installed on the inner side of two single hulls. The present invention relates to a small water environment water quality monitoring and control water surface robot, which can perform image recognition and autonomous path planning, and has functions such as automatic fishing of floating debris on the water surface (including harmful organisms such as blue-green algae), water quality detection, spraying of drugs or feed, etc.

In particular, our robot achieves the following goals:
(1) Automatic collection and real-time detection of water samples from small-scale aquaculture water areas; 
(2) Real time regulation of local water quality, including automatic fishing of floating debris on the water surface and spraying regulators based on water quality testing results; 
(3) Automatic cruise control in small water areas.
