abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has been receiving increased attention and is growing exponentially. AIGC is generated based on the intentional information extracted from human-provided instructions by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models. AIGC quickly and automatically generates large amounts of high-quality content. Currently, there is a shortage of medical resources and complex medical procedures in medicine. Due to its characteristics, AIGC can help alleviate these problems. As a result, the application of AIGC in medicine has gained increased attention in recent years. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review on the recent state of studies involving AIGC in medicine. First, we present an overview of AIGC. Furthermore, based on recent studies, the application of AIGC in medicine is reviewed from two aspects, medical image processing and medical text generation. The basic generative AI models, tasks, target organs, datasets and contribution of studies are considered and summarized. Finally, we also discuss the limitations and challenges faced by AIGC and propose possible solutions with relevant studies. We hope this review can help readers understand the potential of AIGC in medicine and obtain some innovative ideas in this field.
