I'm a master student of <a href='https://faet.fudan.edu.cn/'>Academy for Engineering & Technology</a>, Fudan Univeristy. My research interests including <b>Robotics</b>, <b>3D Vision</b>, <b>Extended Reality</b>, and their application in Medicine. In detail, to achieve automatic, efficient and safe <b>robotic surgery</b>, I research on the technologies of perception and planning for surgical robots including pose estimation, imitation learning and path planning. Moreover, I'm also interested in <b>medical metaverse</b>, which has been a frontier topic in the field of healthcare. For this reason, I did some researches on 3D vision and Extended Reality to reconstruct and display 3D virtual objects (e.g. human model). 

<i>Now my future plan is to look for a PhD position of computer science, biological engineering or automation technology.</i>
